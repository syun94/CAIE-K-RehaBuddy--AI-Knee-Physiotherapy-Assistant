Stand up straight, with your head held high, shoulders relaxed, and your stomach muscles tightened. 
Imagine there’s a string gently pulling you upwards from the top of your head. This helps stretch your spine and make your body straight. Also, use your stomach muscles to support your lower back and stay balanced. When you have good posture, you spread the weight evenly in your body, which can lessen the pressure on your knees.

It’s important to let your arms swing naturally while you walk because it helps your body stay balanced and keeps your walking pace smooth.

Tip: it’s important to wear the right shoes.  take shorter steps instead of taking really long ones.
