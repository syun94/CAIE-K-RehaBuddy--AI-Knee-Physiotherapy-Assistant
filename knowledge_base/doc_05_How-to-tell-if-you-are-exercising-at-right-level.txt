How to tell if you’re exercising at the right level
This guide can help you to understand if you’re exercising at the right level. It’ll also let you see how much pain or discomfort is acceptable.

It can be helpful to rate your pain out of 10 (0 being no pain 10 being the worst pain you have ever had), for example:

0 to 3 – minimal pain
4 to 5 – acceptable pain
6 to 10 – excessive pain
Pain during exercise
Aim to keep your pain within a rating of 0 to 5. If your pain gets above this level, you can change the exercises by:

Reducing the number of times you do a movement
Reducing the speed of a movement
Increasing rest time between movements
Pain after exercise
Exercise should not make your existing knee pain worse overall. However, practicing new exercises can sometimes cause short term muscle pain as the body gets used to moving in new ways. This kind of pain should ease quickly and your pain should be no worse the morning after you’ve exercised.
